# Contributing

Please feel free to open issues at will, from refactoring suggestions to feature suggestions or else.
Also feel free to fork at will, but know that I'm more than happy to incorporate any additional use cases and improvements in this project.

## Creating a new issue:

1. State the problem as the title of the issue. For example - NPE when using X.
2. Be as descriptive as possible in the description of the issue. If the issue is a bug, add steps to reproduce, and any additional information you may find relevant. For new features state the use case as clearly as possible.
3. Assign the issue to me and optionally tag me in a comment.
4. If you can't find a proper tag for the issue don't bother :) Just write what's on your mind.

## Creating a pull request:

1. The main branch is protected by a review process. Make your change in a seperate branch. Name it as GITHUB_USER_NAME/FEATURE_NAME to avoid collisions. E.g codemaster/performance_optimization.
2. Make sure the changes you suggest are as surgeical and specific as possible. Don't include more than one idea in a PR.
3. Tag me as reviewer
